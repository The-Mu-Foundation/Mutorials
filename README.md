## Helping Mutorials
We're happy that you want to help us! Below is a quick overview of how to do so.

### Providing Feedback
The development team is available for feedback at our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/nmuHMQ).

### Reporting Issues / Feature Request
If you've found a bug or would like to propose a feature request, first look at [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/The-Mu-Foundation/Mutorials/issues) to see if someone else has already done so. If so, and if you have additional information, please add that information as a comment. If not, please [open an issue in GitHub](https://github.com/The-Mu-Foundation/Mutorials/issues/new).

- Please file a single issue per problem and feature request. Do not list multiple bugs or feature requests in the same issue.
- Provide as much information as you can. The more information you give us, the more likely we'll be able to fix it.

Please include the following information in each issue:
- Date of bug
- Your operating system
- Your browser
- A list of browser extensions (including, but not limited to, any adblockers)
- Reproducible steps that cause the issue (First I did this, then that...)
- A screenshot or screen recording of the issue
- If you can: open the developer console and paste any issues that pop up there.

We might ask for additional information to help us fix the bug. Please check back on your issue every few days. We typically will close issues if there has been no response to follow-up questions within 7 days.
